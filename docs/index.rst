Welcome to Distro Tracker's Documentation!
==========================================

Distro Tracker is the name of the software that powers the
`Debian Package Tracker <https://tracker.debian.org>`_.

This software lets you follow the evolution of a Debian-based
distribution both with email updates and with a comprehensive web
interface.

Having all the information about packages conveniently available in a
single place is particularly interesting for package maintainers,
contributors, advanced users, etc.

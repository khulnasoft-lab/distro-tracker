distro-tracker test keys
========================

Three public keys are used in the unit tests, with two signed messages.
Make sure any changes to these keys abide by the following conventions:

- All public keys set to never expire
- All secret keys set to use the trivial passphrase: tracker
- Subkeys may be set as revoked or expired, as required by the tests.
- Keys and tests are arranged so that tests continue passing without
  manual changes.
- Public and secret keys to be held as ASCII files in git.
- Test keys are not to be used for any other uses.
- Encryption subkeys are not required, only signing subkeys are used.

Recent versions of gpg will set expiry on the public key and the
subkey if --generate-key or --gen-key is used. Either use --full-generate-key
or edit the uid and the subkey after generation.

Create the uids in the order of the existing keys - once each revoked
uid is created, select it and revoke the uid. This maintains the
original ordering of the uids which is important for some unit tests.

gpg no longer accepts a UID with just an email address:

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: just-an-email@example.net
Email address:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "just-an-email@example.net"

Please don't put the email address into the real name or the comment
Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (Q)uit? n

So the just-an-email@example.net has been dropped.

distro-tracker test keys
========================

Three public keys are used in the unit tests, with two signed messages.
Make sure any changes to these keys abide by the following conventions:

- All public keys set to never expire
- All secret keys set to use the trivial passphrase: tracker
- Subkeys may be set as revoked or expired, as required by the tests.
- Keys and tests are arranged so that tests continue passing without
  manual changes.
- Public and secret keys to be held as ASCII files in git.
- Test keys are not to be used for any other uses.
- Encryption subkeys are not required, only signing subkeys are used.

Recent versions of gpg will set expiry on the public key and the
subkey if --generate-key or --gen-key is used. Either use --full-generate-key
or edit the uid and the subkey after generation.

Create the uids in the order of the existing keys - once each revoked
uid is created, select it and revoke the uid. This maintains the
original ordering of the uids which is important for some unit tests.

[ultimate] (2)  Just A Name

gpg no longer accepts a UID with just an email address:

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: just-an-email@example.net
Email address:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "just-an-email@example.net"

Please don't put the email address into the real name or the comment
Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (Q)uit? n

So the just-an-email@example.net has been dropped.

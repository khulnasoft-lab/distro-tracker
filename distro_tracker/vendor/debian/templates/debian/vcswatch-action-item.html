{% if status == "NEW" %}
this package seems to have a new changelog entry (version
{{item.extra_data.changelog_version}}, distribution
{{item.extra_data.changelog_distribution}}) and new commits
in its VCS. You should consider whether it's time to make
an upload.
{% if item.extra_data.vcslog %}
<br/><br/>
Here are the relevant commit messages:
<pre>
{{item.extra_data.vcslog}}
</pre>
{% endif %}
{% elif status == "COMMITS" %}
this package seems to have new commits in its VCS but has
not yet updated debian/changelog. You should consider updating
the Debian changelog and uploading this new version into the archive.
<br/><br/>
Here are the relevant commit logs:
<pre>
{{item.extra_data.vcslog}}
</pre>
{% elif status == "OLD" %}
the current version of the package is not in its VCS.<br/>
Either you need to push your commits and/or your tags, or the information about
the package's VCS are out of date. A common cause of the latter issue when
using the Git VCS is not specifying the correct branch when the packaging is
not in the default one (remote HEAD branch), which is usually "master" but can
be modified in salsa.debian.org in the project's general settings with the
"Default Branch" field). Alternatively the Vcs-Git field in debian/control can
contain a "-b &lt;branch-name&gt;" suffix to indicate what branch is used
for the Debian packaging.
{% elif status == "UNREL" %}
this package has been uploaded into the archive but the debian/changelog in the
VCS is still UNRELEASED.  You should consider pushing the missing commits
or updating the VCS.
{% elif status == "ERROR" %}
there is an error with this package's VCS, or the debian/changelog file inside
it. Please check the error shown below and try to fix it. You might have
to update the VCS URL in the debian/control file to point to the correct
repository.
{% elif status == "DEFAULT" %}
a new type of VCS status has been added.
